Over 350,000 Entrepreneurs Served Since 2003 Founded by 2 entrepreneurs, Grasshopper has been making it easier to start and grow a small business since 2003. Back then, we started as just two guys with a dream and to date have served 350,000 entrepreneurs (and we're still growing). Today our commitment to helping entrepreneurs is stronger than ever, and we continue to develop new and innovative tools to help them change the world. Grasshopper employees are outstanding at what they do, and we expect nothing less from prospective candidates. We're looking for dynamic team players that set the bar high, and then surpass it. We're not talking about automatically though- you've got to have a little soul. That means we expect you to play as hard as you work. Luckily, at Grasshopper it's possible to do both.
